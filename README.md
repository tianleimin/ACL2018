# Multimodal sentiment analysis with multi-task learning

**Unimodal and multimodal uni-task, bi-task, and tri-task learning models for sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSI database.**

* In uni-task models we perform regression experiments to predict sentiment scores.

* In bi-task models we perform multi-task learning experiments which have sentiment score regression as the main task, and intensity **or** polarity classification as the auxiliary task.

* In tri-task models we perform multi-task learing experiments which have sentiment score regression as the main task, and intensity **and** polarity classification as the auxiliary tasks.

* In multimodal models we compare Early Fusion, Late Fusion, Hierarchical Fusion, and Tensor Fusion Network.

**These codes are for our ACL2018 Computational Modeling of Human Multimodal Language Workshop paper:**

The Hierarchical Fusion model in the multimodal experiments is based on our previous work:
